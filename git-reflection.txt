Whats the difference between git and GitHub?

Git is a distributed source control repository. It's a version control system. 

GitHub is a webservice that uses Git. 

Can you think of an analogy to describe them?

Git is the system and GitHub is a website that uses the system. 

Do you think you would still remember the difference a week from now if you didn't revisit the material?

Yes.

Did you stick to the timebox suggestions? If not, why not?

Loosely. 

What is a GitHub work flow?

Working and collaborating with others. Having a work directory, staging information then putting it in a repository. Checking others work before you merge. Going back to a previous save if you change your mind on the most recent file. 

What did you notice about your own learning? What did you do when you were confused or blocked?

I need to read things over and over again for it to make sense in my brain. Sometimes I will be reading something and not even realise that I am just looking at the words and not taking the information in. When I am confused I'll write the important information down in my notebook and have my 10th instant coffee and read it over and over. If I'm still confused I'll ask Jossie. 

Is there anything you'd do differently if you were to repeat the learning exploration again?

Take more breaks.
